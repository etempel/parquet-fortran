"""Checks three structural invariants of src/*.f90 that no compiler and no runtime test can see.

Each one protects a property whose violation compiles cleanly, passes the whole test suite, and
fails somewhere else entirely -- in a user's program, on another compiler, or in a coverage report.
That is what makes them worth a static check rather than a test:

  1. `parquet_table` must have NO allocatable component (feature_risks.md Risk-13).
     The type is finalizable, so every allocatable component it gains makes the compiler generate a
     deeper recursive walk for its `intent(out)` entry and its FINAL -- and this project has three
     confirmed compiler bugs in exactly that machinery on exactly this type (gfortran leaving an
     OpenMP `private()` copy uninitialized; `%detached` surviving an `intent(out)` reset; ifx
     segfaulting inside its own runtime on a nested derived-type component). New table state goes on
     `parquet_table_cache`, reached through the pointer. See CLAUDE.md, "New `parquet_table` state
     goes on the CACHE".

  2. Every pointer a table accessor hands out must be reached through `self%cache` (feature_risks.md Risk-12).
     `%col` needs no `target` attribute on the caller's table only because the pointer targets heap
     owned by the cache rather than the dummy argument, so F2018 15.5.2.4's "pointer to a dummy's
     target becomes undefined on return" never applies. An accessor that points at `self` directly
     reintroduces the `target` requirement with no compiler diagnostic and no runtime check: the
     library still compiles, every test still passes, and a caller's program corrupts memory.
     `target` is a requirement on the CALLER, which is why nothing on this side can catch it.

  3. Generated files must carry the conventions their generator is supposed to emit (feature_risks.md Risk-19).
     `--check` on the generators compares the committed file against the generator, so a TEMPLATE
     that omits a `!>` doc-comment or a `! GCOVR_EXCL_LINE` produces output that matches perfectly
     and is wrong in every kind it emits at once. Only `ford --warn docs.md` would reveal the first
     (and it is not run in CI, and is drowned in thousands of expected warnings -- see CLAUDE.md's
     "FORD doc-comment conventions"), and nothing at all reveals the second. A third generator
     inherits this check for free by adding its output to GENERATED_FILES below.

Usage:
    tools/check_source_conventions.py            # run every check
    tools/check_source_conventions.py --list     # print what each check covers, then exit

Exits nonzero and prints one line per violation, each naming file:line and what to do instead.
