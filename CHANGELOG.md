## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`parquet_spatial`: `pf_spatial_index`, a uniform-grid spatial index over plain coordinate
  arrays.** Ball search into a caller-owned buffer, the self-join as CSR, the pair list and
  count-only forms, all threaded; `k`-nearest search (`%nearest`) and every point's `k`-th
  neighbour distance at once (`%kth_distance`); segment, cylinder and truncated-cone searches
  around an axis, reporting where on the axis each point sits (`axis_point=`/`axis_t=`);
  search on the sky by angular radius (`%build_sky`/`%within_sky`/`%nearest_sky`/
  `%kth_distance_sky` plus the three bulk forms `%all_within_sky`/`%pairs_within_sky`/
  `%count_all_within_sky`, degrees in and degrees out); two or three dimensions; optional periodic
  boundaries with the minimum-image convention; and an automatically chosen cell size. Every
  radius query takes an optional inner radius (`r_inner=`), making the ball an annulus, and can
  return its rows ordered by distance (`sorted=`). Every bulk query takes one radius or one per
  point; the pair list is symmetric under a per-point radius (a pair qualifies when either ball
  reaches the other) while the CSR and count forms are directed. `pf_connected_components` labels
  an edge list's connected components, so a Friends-of-Friends group finder is `%pairs_within`
  followed by one more call. A new Arrow-free entry module (`use parquet_spatial` compiles nine
  Fortran files), with `spatial_threads` and `spatial_rebuild_warning` joining the process-global
  settings.
- **`parquet_list`: `parquet_list_column`, a variable-length list column, plus `parquet_list_row`,
  a lightweight handle to one of its rows.** Rows may hold different numbers of values, including
  none, and a row may be a null (absent) list distinct from a present but empty one; element nulls
  inside a row are tracked separately from row nulls. Nine scalar payload kinds, an
  offsets-plus-payload layout matching Arrow's, geometric growth, deep copy, move, and a
  `%gather_rows` rebuild that serves reordering, filtering and duplication. A `parquet_column` can
  take ownership of one through the new `%adopt_container`, which is how the container reaches the
  rest of the library. A new Arrow-free entry module (`use parquet_list` compiles eleven Fortran
  files) that reads no settings. **In-memory only for now**: a list column cannot yet be read from
  or written to a Parquet file, held by a `parquet_table`, or nested inside another container.

### Changed

- **`parquet_write_table`'s `copy_metadata=`/`metadata_keys=` no longer carry a key the writer
  generates itself** — `DATE`, `name`, the two `IVOA.VOTable-Parquet.*` keys and every
  `column.<name>.<attr>` entry. `copy_metadata=.true.` skips them; `metadata_keys=` naming one is
  now an error. A copied file previously carried a second entry for each, and for `column.*` that
  second entry was the one a reader got back.

### Fixed

- Many other minor fixes and improvements.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-24

**Toolchain floor:** gfortran ≥ 13 (13 on CI; 15.2.0 the primary development target), and —
confirmed by hand rather than by CI — Intel Fortran (ifx) 2026.1.0/2026.1.1, NAG Fortran 7.2, and
LLVM flang 22.1.8 (serial builds only). Also fpm ≥ 0.13.0, a C++20-capable C++ compiler, and
Arrow/Parquet C++ ≥ 24.0.0 (validated locally against 25.0.0). See
[Prerequisites](README.md#prerequisites) for the full detail.

**SemVer scope:** the promise covers the whole `use parquet` surface — every public
type/procedure/constant reachable that way, including a public type's own type-bound procedures and
operators — and, new in this release, each advertised entry module *in its own right*
(`parquet_io`, `parquet_tables`, `parquet_columns`, `parquet_strings`, `parquet_temporal`,
`parquet_sorting`, `parquet_argsort`, `parquet_sampling`, `parquet_random`, `parquet_settings`,
`parquet_version`, `parquet_maml_base`), since a module offered as an entry point has to stay usable
through that import alone. `parquet_core`, `parquet_bindings` and every `*_base`/`*_engine`/
`*_kernel` module are explicitly outside it.

**Compatibility:** three source-incompatible changes and two behaviour changes, each listed under
Changed — `parquet_set_max_threads` is renamed, `sample_seed=` widens to `integer(int64)`, and
`parquet_get_version(v, mode=)` is removed; a file written without an explicit `compression=` now
uses zstd rather than snappy, and a schema field declaring no `qc: miss:` no longer means "no Nulls
allowed". Parquet files written by 1.0.0 are read unchanged.

### Added

- **`parquet_tables` (`parquet_table`)**: a whole parquet file as one in-memory object.
  `parquet_open_table` reads each column on first use; `%get` hands one back as an ordinary Fortran
  array and `%col` as a zero-copy typed pointer. Tables can be built in memory (`parquet_new_table`,
  `%add_column`, `%append`), mutated (`%sort_by`, `%filter_rows`, `%top_n`, `%delete_rows`,
  `%truncate`, `%cast`), opened as a row slice, cloned, written back out (`parquet_write_table`),
  and used from several threads with the library enforcing the rules rather than documenting them.
- **`parquet_columns` (`parquet_column`)**: type-erased whole-column value storage over 18 scalar
  and vector kinds, with per-element null tracking and the full value and structural instruction
  set.
- **`parquet_sorting`**: sorting for plain Fortran arrays and column types over eleven element
  types — `pf_argsort`, `pf_sort`, `pf_permute`, `pf_is_sorted`, `pf_partial_argsort`, multi-key
  sorting through `pf_sort_keys`, binary search, unique and reduction operations, and group
  boundaries from the same pass as the sort. Read-time sorting, `parquet_table%sort_by` and
  `pf_argsort` are one engine, so they cannot disagree about null placement, NaN placement or tie
  order.
- **`parquet_random` and `parquet_sampling`**: a counter-based generator whose value at
  `(seed, index)` is a pure function of its coordinates rather than of call order, so a parallel
  loop returns the same numbers at any thread count or schedule. Uniform, integer, exponential,
  normal, gamma and Poisson draws; permutations, subsets and resampling; and weighted sampling
  without replacement (`pf_weighted_draw`, `pf_weighted_subset`, `pf_weighted_permutation`).
- **`parquet_settings`**: process-global settings — Arrow's thread pool, per-area thread caps,
  default compression codec and level, terminal verbosity and message stream, the sort's integer
  counting fast path, target row-group size and the statistics prescreen — with
  `parquet_print_settings`, `parquet_reset_settings` and one `PARQUET_FORTRAN_*` environment
  variable per knob.
- **Reproducible file output**: `parquet_set_file_date`/`parquet_get_file_date`, and
  `PARQUET_FORTRAN_FILE_DATE`, pin the `DATE` metadata key to a given `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` instead
  of reading the clock, so the same data written twice produces byte-identical files. An empty
  value, the default, reads the clock as before.
- **Every layer of the library is now an entry module in its own right**, each covered by the
  version promise and each far cheaper to compile against than `use parquet`: `parquet_io`,
  `parquet_tables`, `parquet_columns`, `parquet_sorting`, `parquet_argsort`, `parquet_sampling`,
  `parquet_random`, `parquet_strings`, `parquet_temporal`, `parquet_settings` and
  `parquet_version`. Eight of them no longer reach the Parquet C++ bindings at all. `use parquet`
  is unchanged and remains the recommended import.
- **Row filters are boolean expressions** over a file's columns — `and`/`or`/`not`, parentheses and
  precedence — rather than AND-combined clauses only, and a filter can be installed after open with
  `parquet_reader_set_filter`.
- **Read-time sorting**: `parquet_open_reader(..., sort_by=)` and `parquet_reader_set_sort` return a
  file's rows ordered by one or more columns, with per-key direction and null placement. Streaming
  and chunked reads now work on a filtered, sampled or sorted reader.
- **Generated table types**: `tools/generate_user_table_code.py` turns a MAML schema into a named
  `parquet_table` extension with one accessor per declared column.
- **`parquet_read_qc` and `parquet_compose_read_qc`**: read-time quality control declared in code
  and composed against whatever a file's own qc-MAML declares.
- **Reader queries answered without materializing a column**: `parquet_get_column_names`,
  `parquet_get_metadata_items`, `parquet_get_physical_row_indices`, `parquet_get_qc_columns`,
  `parquet_get_column_nullable`, `parquet_column_has_nulls`, `parquet_measure_list_width` and
  `parquet_release_column`.
- **Typed table metadata records its own type in the written file**, as a companion
  `<KEY>.datatype` entry, so a value written with `schema%add_metadata("NSIDE", 1024_int32)` reads
  back as an `int32` rather than as the indistinguishable string `1024`.
- **NAG Fortran 7.2 and LLVM flang are tested toolchains**, alongside gfortran and ifx. flang builds
  are serial only; see [Prerequisites](README.md#prerequisites) for what each one needs.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `parquet_set_max_threads` is renamed to `parquet_set_arrow_threads`.** The old name is
  removed rather than kept as an alias, so a call to it no longer compiles.
- **BREAKING: `sample_seed=` is now `integer(int64)`**, and for a given seed
  `parquet_open_reader(..., sample_fraction=)` selects a different set of rows than it did in 1.0.0.
- **BREAKING: `parquet_get_version(v, mode="arrow")` and `mode="parquet"` are removed.**
  `parquet_get_arrow_version` reports the linked Arrow and Parquet C++ versions instead.
- **`parquet_open_writer`'s default compression is now `zstd` at level 3**, changed from `snappy`,
  and `float32`/`float64` columns are written with BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT encoding and dictionary
  encoding disabled.
- **A schema built with `schema%init`/`schema%add_field` no longer needs a `parquet_parse_maml`
  call**, and those calls no longer have a required order. `%add_field` now applies the same
  per-field validation `parquet_validate_maml` applies.
- **`qc: miss:` has three states**, and a field that declares none no longer means "no Nulls
  allowed" — it now says nothing about Nulls, and none are checked on either the write or the read
  side.
- **`parquet_write_column_chunk` converts a chunk's values to the schema's declared numeric type**,
  exactly as `parquet_write_column` always has.
- **A streamed column's nullability comes from its first row group's `is_valid` mask**, and every
  row group must agree. A vector column's element field is written non-nullable when nothing can
  put a Null in it.
- **Closing a schema-enforced writer that had nothing written to it produces a valid empty file**
  instead of aborting.
- **`parquet_get_column_type` and `parquet_column_exists(types=)` report the narrowest lossless
  Fortran kind** a column can be read into, rather than whether its physical type is one of nine
  names.
- **Reads, writes, filtering, sorting and string columns are substantially faster**, in many cases
  by several times: temporal reads, string reads and writes, quality-control checks, filter
  evaluation, sorts over columns containing nulls, validity handling, and column lookup on a wide
  table. A `parquet_table`'s per-column work and one `parquet_string_column`'s bulk work now also
  run on several threads.
- **The user guide is reorganised into six groups**, so every published page URL changed from
  `page/<name>.html` to `page/<group>/<name>.html`.

### Fixed

- **An integer `qc: min:`/`max:` bound is exact at any magnitude.** Bounds were parsed and compared
  through `float64`, so past 2^53 a bound could round and a violating value be accepted.
- **An unrecognised `qc: miss:` value in a schema MAML is rejected** instead of silently meaning the
  opposite of what it says.
- **A MAML key is case-insensitive everywhere, including block headers.** A capitalised `Extra:`
  silently lost the whole block.
- **MAML files are read correctly**: lines beyond 1024 characters are no longer silently truncated,
  a CRLF file no longer produces a misleading type error, and a spurious length abort under heavy
  thread contention is gone.
- **`parquet_date`/`parquet_timestamp` offset arithmetic and `%to_unix` no longer misjudge their own
  overflow guards under nagfor**, which could abort on an ordinary date or wrap silently past
  `int64`.
- **Sharing one `parquet_reader`/`parquet_writer` across threads aborts with the documented
  diagnostic**, instead of segfaulting, or hanging when several threads trip the guard at once.
- **Two heap-corruption races on first concurrent use of Arrow's own type singletons are fixed**
  (confirmed with ThreadSanitizer).
- **A struct-nested string column read through the compact buffer path no longer returns every row
  as Null** (a use-after-free).
- **The library no longer kills a process whose IEEE traps are unmasked**: both
  `parquet_close_reader(print_stat=.true.)` and writing a NaN to an int-declared column trapped.
- Many other minor fixes and improvements.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-27

**Toolchain floor:** gfortran ≥ 13 (13 on CI; 15.2.0 the primary development target), Intel
Fortran (ifx) 2026.1.0 (confirmed manually; not exercised by CI), a C++20-capable C++ compiler,
and Arrow/Parquet C++ ≥ 24.0.0 (validated locally against 25.0.0). See
[Prerequisites](README.md#prerequisites) for the full detail.

**SemVer scope:** the stability promise covers the whole `use parquet` surface documented under
README's [API stability](README.md#important-behavior) — every public type/procedure/constant reachable
that way, including a public type's own type-bound procedures and operators; anything not
reachable via `use parquet` (private module internals, the C++ surface, file/module layout) can
change in a minor or patch release.

**Compatibility:** 1.0.0 is the first published release (no prior `0.9.x` version was ever
tagged or published to the fpm registry), so there is no prior-release file format to remain
compatible with.

### Added

- Read and write parquet columns for `int32`/`int64`/`float32`/`float64`/`logical`/`character`
  (MAML: `boolean`/`string`), as plain 1D columns or fixed-length vector columns.
- Read and write `DATE`/`TIME`/`TIMESTAMP` columns (`parquet_date`/`parquet_time`/
  `parquet_timestamp`), nanosecond-precision, with ISO-8601 and Unix-time/MJD/JD interop,
  same-type difference/offset arithmetic (`operator(-)`/`operator(+)`, `%diff_seconds`, and the
  `parquet_ns_per_sec`/`parquet_ns_per_day`/`parquet_ns_to_sec`/`parquet_ns_to_day` conversion
  constants), and reading back a column's stored unit/timezone (`parquet_get_column_time_info`).
- Compact `parquet_string_column` type for variable-length string columns without pre-sizing,
  with search/mutation (`find`, `contains`/`startswith`/`endswith`/`equals`, `append`/`set`/
  `erase`), zero-copy element handles (`view`/`view_all`/`view_slice`), gathering handles back
  into a column (`build_from`), an owning row-range copy (`slice`), `clone`/`move`/`swap`, and
  summary statistics.
- Schema and metadata definition/validation from a MAML file, or built directly in code
  (`schema%init`/`add_field`/`add_metadata`), including column renaming (`col_map:`),
  quality-control range checks (`qc:`), Null-protected columns (`protected_cols:`), automatic
  `col_size`/`array_size` resolution at write time (`parquet_size_auto`), inspecting/copying an
  existing field (`schema%get_field`/`add_field_from`), and a human-readable schema dump
  (`schema%print_schema_info`).
- Read-time quality control: checking an already-written file's data against a qc-maml
  (`parquet_load_qc_maml_file`, `qc=`/`qc_soft=` on `parquet_open_reader`), independent of the
  `qc:` enforcement performed on write.
- Reading a file's stored metadata back (`parquet_get_metadata`) and prefetching columns
  (`parquet_prefetch_columns`).
- Genuine Parquet Null support on read/write, via value substitution or a validity mask.
- Row filtering on read (`parquet_filter`), random downsampling (`sample_fraction`/`sample_seed`),
  and row masking on write (`parquet_write_row_mask`/`parquet_write_chunk_row_mask`, dropping rows
  entirely rather than substituting Null), plus streaming/chunked reads and writes for large
  columns and row-mode/element-mode random-access reads.
- Reading a column into a widened numeric kind (including `int8`/`int16`/unsigned integers/
  `half_float`/`decimal32..256`), `STRING_VIEW`, foreign `LIST`/`LARGE_LIST` columns, and nested
  `STRUCT` fields via a dot-separated path.
- Reader queries answered from the file's schema/footer without reading column data: a column's
  existence/type (`parquet_column_exists`/`parquet_get_column_type`), row-group count
  (`parquet_get_num_row_groups`), vector-column width/total element count (`parquet_get_col_size`/
  `parquet_get_column_total_elements`), and a string column's longest stored value
  (`parquet_get_string_length`).
- Control over output compression codec, compression level, and row group size; opting out of
  silently overwriting an existing file (`overwrite=.false.` on `parquet_open_writer`); printing
  per-column read statistics on close (`print_stat=` on `parquet_close_reader`).
- Thread-safe concurrent use (e.g. from OpenMP), with control over Arrow's internal thread-pool
  size (`parquet_set_max_threads`).
- Support for embedding your own MAML schemas into a downstream project.
