# Fortran parquet library for WAVES/4HS

Library to read/write parquet files and handle MAML files.

## Prerequisites

The code compiles successfully with the following compilers and libraries. It might compile with previous or later versions as well but this is not tested.

- Fortran compiler:
    - Intel Fortran (ifx) v2025.3.0
    - Gfortran v15.2.0
- FPM ([Fortran Package Manager](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/))
- apache-arrow (C++ library for reading/writing parquet files)

Unit testing is handled using test-drive, which is automatically installed by FPM.

### Environment variables

To build the code with intel compiles, the following environment variables should be set:

- LIBRARY_PATH should point to the Healpix and cfitsio lib directories.
- CPATH should point to the Healpix and cfitsio include directories.
- LD_LIBRARY_PATH should point to the cfitsio lib directory
- FPM_FC can be used to set fortran compiler for FPM (e.g. FPM_FC=ifx)

In bash you can initialise them as follows:

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=path_healpix/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    export LIBRARY_PATH=path_healpix/lib:path_cfitsio/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
    export CPATH=path_healpix/include:path_cfitsio/include:$CPATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_cfitsio/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export FPM_FC=ifx

NB! It might depend on the operating system and fortran compiler what environment variables are needed.

## Building and installing instructions

To test the code:

    fpm test

To clean the build directory:

    fpm clean
    
To clean the build directory and all dependencies:

    fpm clean --all

To generate the executable:

    fpm install --prefix my_path

The executable is placed in the my_path/bin directory.

## Reading parquet files from your fortran code

To use this library in another Fortran project, add it as an FPM dependency in your project's `fpm.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
parquet-fortran = { path = "/path/to/parquet-fortran" }
```

Then `use parquet` in your code.

Minimal reader example:

```fortran
program read_parquet_example
    use parquet
    use iso_fortran_env, only: int32, int64
    implicit none

    type(parquet_reader) :: reader
    integer(int64) :: nrows
    integer(int32), allocatable :: id(:)

    call parquet_open_reader(reader, "data.parquet")
    call parquet_get_nrows(reader, nrows)

    allocate(id(nrows))
    call parquet_read_column(reader, "id", id)

    call parquet_close_reader(reader)
end program read_parquet_example
```

Notes:

- `parquet_get_nrows` returns the number of table rows.
- Allocate output arrays before calling `parquet_read_column`.
- For string columns, choose a fixed string length that is large enough for your data.
- For vector/array columns, allocate 2D arrays with shape `(col_size, nrows)`.

## Writing parquet files from your fortran code

Minimal writer example:

```fortran
program write_parquet_example
    use parquet
    use iso_fortran_env, only: int32, real64
    implicit none

    type(parquet_writer) :: writer
    integer(int32) :: id(3)
    real(real64) :: value(3)

    id = [1_int32, 2_int32, 3_int32]
    value = [10.0_real64, 20.0_real64, 30.0_real64]

    call parquet_open_writer(writer, "data.parquet")
    call parquet_write_column(writer, "id", id)
    call parquet_write_column(writer, "value", value)
    call parquet_close_writer(writer)
end program write_parquet_example
```

If you want explicit column definitions and table metadata, first parse a MAML file and pass `cinfo` and `metadata` to `parquet_open_writer`.

```fortran
type(parquet_column_info), allocatable :: cinfo(:)
type(parquet_table_metadata) :: metadata

call parquet_read_maml("maml_example.maml", cinfo, metadata)
call parquet_open_writer(writer, "data.parquet", cinfo, metadata)
```

Notes:

- Every call to `parquet_write_column` writes one full column.
- All columns in one file must contain the same number of rows.
- Close the writer with `parquet_close_writer` to flush data and finalize the file.

The parquet file metadata can be defined using the [MAML-format](https://github.com/asgr/MAML-Format).
