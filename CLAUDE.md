# Instructions for Claude

## New features require tests and docs

Whenever asked to implement a new feature in this repository, always:

1. Add unit test coverage for it (in the relevant `test/*.f90` suite; add abort/error-path
   coverage via `test/error_scenarios.f90` + `test/test_errors.f90` +
   `tools/run_error_scenarios.sh` if the feature has failure modes that `error stop`).
2. Update documentation: README.md (public API/behavior), CONTRIBUTING.md (if it affects
   contributor workflow), and CHANGELOG.md (an entry under `[Unreleased]`).

Do this without being asked separately each time — it applies by default to any
"implement/add feature" request in this repo, not just when explicitly reminded.

## Checking documentation links

After editing headings or `#anchor` links in README.md/CONTRIBUTING.md/CHANGELOG.md, run
`tools/check_doc_anchors.py` to verify every in-page and cross-file anchor link still
resolves against GitHub's actual heading-slug rules. It exits nonzero and lists any broken
link.

## Report before implementing on analysis/audit requests

When asked to analyze, audit, or review something (naming conventions, documentation
duplication/coverage, test coverage, etc.), report findings and a proposed plan first and
wait for confirmation before editing any files. Only proceed straight to editing when
explicitly asked to implement/fix/add something directly.

## Stale `fpm` build cache

If `fpm test` behaves unexpectedly after source changes (e.g. a test target seems to run
old code), try `fpm clean --all` to force a clean rebuild before spending time debugging —
fpm's build cache can serve a stale binary.

## Renames/refactors: only apply low-blast-radius changes

When renaming or refactoring existing (non-new) code for consistency, only apply the
renames/changes that are low blast-radius (few call sites, no public API/doc impact).
For anything with wider knock-on effects (public API, many call sites, cross-file
conventions), report it as a proposed change and wait for confirmation instead of applying
it directly.

## Naming conventions

Follow these when adding new public API, types, or internal helpers:

- **Public module-level API** (anything in `src/parquet.f90`'s `public ::` list — functions,
  subroutines, types) always carries the `parquet_` prefix, e.g. `parquet_get_metadata`,
  `parquet_open_reader`, `parquet_schema`.
- **Type-bound procedures** (`schema%init`, `schema%add_field`, `reader%...`) do *not* need a
  `parquet_` prefix — the type itself namespaces them. If the natural short name collides
  with another type's backing implementation, keep the short name as the type-bound binding
  target and give the private module procedure a distinguishing name (e.g.
  `parquet_column_info`'s binding `set_column_available => set_available`, kept short only to
  avoid colliding with `parquet_schema`'s own `set_column_available` impl).
- **`maml_` prefix** is reserved specifically for MAML-parsing/building internal helpers
  (e.g. `maml_push_line`, `maml_line_exists`) — don't reuse it for unrelated internal code.
- **Other private module-level helpers** (in `parquet_metadata.f90`, `parquet_read.f90`,
  `parquet_write.f90`) generally keep the `parquet_` prefix too, even though private —
  matches the existing majority convention in those files; only give it a bare, unprefixed
  name if it's a small, obviously-local helper (rare; check for existing precedent first).
- **Private module-level types** (not part of the public API, e.g. `maml_section_schema`)
  drop the `parquet_` prefix — this is intentional, not an inconsistency to "fix".
- **C++ bindings** (`parquet_bindings.f90` interfaces, `parquet_wrapper.cpp`) mirror the C++
  side's own naming (still generally `parquet_`-prefixed for the `extern "C"` surface) —
  don't rename these to match Fortran-side conventions.

When in doubt, grep for an existing analogous name before inventing a new convention.

## Running a single test suite/test

Use `fpm test run_tester -- <suite>` to run just one test-drive suite (e.g. `fpm test
run_tester -- reading`), or `fpm test run_tester -- <suite> "<test name>"` to run a single
named test within it. Prefer this over a full `fpm test` while iterating — the full suite
(including OpenMP/error-scenario subprocess tests) takes much longer than the one suite
relevant to a given change.

## Regression tests for "sized/typed from the first element" bugs

When writing a regression test for a bug where a value/size/length was incorrectly derived
from the first element of an array/vector column (e.g. the string-vector-column tests in
`test/test_reading.f90` — `test_read_string_vector_short_first`), construct the fixture so
the first element is deliberately the extreme/shortest case and a later element is longer.
A fixture where the first element happens to be the longest (or same-length) can pass even
if the underlying bug is still present.

## Public numeric arguments: provide both int32 and int64 kinds

When adding a public procedure argument that holds a row count / size / index (any integer a
caller might naturally declare as a plain `INTEGER`), make it generic over **both**
`integer(int32)` and `integer(int64)`, following the existing `parquet_get_nrows_int32`/
`parquet_get_nrows_int64` overload pattern. An `integer(int64)`-only dummy forces callers
with a default-kind `INTEGER` variable into a `Type mismatch ... passed INTEGER(4) to
INTEGER(8)` compile error (this shipped once for `parquet_open_reader`'s `nrows=` before
being fixed).

Fortran constraint that shapes this: an *optional* dummy that differs only by kind cannot be
the sole disambiguator between specific procedures in a generic interface (a call omitting it
is ambiguous). So when such an argument is optional, carry the argument-absent case as its
own separate specific rather than an optional dummy — see `parquet_open_reader`'s split into
`parquet_open_reader_base` (no `nrows`) plus `parquet_open_reader_nrows_int32`/`_int64`
(required `nrows`), all under one generic interface.

## Error stop messages: include file/schema context

New `error stop` messages in the read/write/schema-building paths should append the relevant
file and, where applicable, schema/maml name using the existing helpers — `writer_context_suffix`
(`parquet_write.f90`), `reader_filename_suffix` (`parquet_read.f90`), `maml_name_suffix`
(`parquet_metadata.f90`) — rather than naming only the offending column/field, so a failure is
identifiable when several readers/writers/schemas are in play at once. These are only
meaningful once the reader/writer/schema knows its file/name (i.e. post-open), so the
guard-clause "…has not been opened" messages are exempt.
